# Gesture Controlled Game using Computer Vision

## Project Description
This project controls a game using hand gestures detected through a webcam. A yellow object is tracked, and upward movement triggers the SPACE key.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyAutoGUI

## How It Works
Webcam detects yellow object → tracks motion → presses SPACE when object moves up.

## How to Run
pip install opencv-python numpy pyautogui  
python main.py
